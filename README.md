EECS 494 Game Prototype

Game Rules:
- Players alternate turns, attempting to score fireball hits on the other player.
- Each player gets three actions per turn.
  Taking an action 3 times (not necessarily consecutively) charges up the "super" version of that action.
  The actions available are:
    1) Move (1 space) / Super: Dash (3 spaces)
    2) Fireball (1 space) / Super: Fireball (4 spaces, destroys obstacles)
    3) Place wall tile (range of 2) / Super: Place wall tile (anywhere)
- Each time an action is taken, all fireballs on the board move one space in the direction they were facing.
- The first player to score three hits on the opposing player wins!
